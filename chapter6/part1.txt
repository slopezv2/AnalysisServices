Junk dimensions: Created by merging several attributes that do not belong to any
other dimension, and that you don't want to keep as separate dimensions to
avoid a dimensional explosion

Current value for an attribute.
Products[Current List Price] = 
LOOKUPVALUE ( 
    Products[List Price],
    Products[Product Code], Products[Product Code],
    Products[ScdStatus], "Current"
)

All the sales made in the past as if they were made at the current Price
Products[Actualized Sales Amount] :=
SUMX ( 
    Sales,
    Sales[Line Quantity] * RELATED ( Products[Current List Price] )
)
in case you don't have a column to identify the current column:
Products[ Current List Price usinf ScdStartDate] =
VAR LastDateofProduct =
    CALCULATE (
        MAX ( Products[ScdStartDate]),
        ALLEXCEPT ( Products, Products[Product Code])
    )
RETURN
    LOOKUPVALUE (
        Products[List Price],
        Products[ScdStartDate], LastDateofProduct,
        Products[Product Code], Products[Product Code]
    )

Snapshot fact tables:
Related to aggregated data for previous time in a fact table, Dax can help
with time-intelligence functions or you can aggregations to store specific
aggregated data

Generally, there is a performance penalty at query time by using the 
dynamic calculation, but it seems that this penalty might disappear on 
large result sets. We have observer better performance in dynamic 
calculation with a large result set, which could be the case of a 
chart displaying the stock level over time for different products. 
You should carefully test the performance and the space saving of 
dynamic calculation with your data before choosing to implement it in 
production.

Load data from views: Loading data from views is the best practice for
creating  a model in Analysis Services and reduce maintenance cost

Global recommendations:
1. Create a schema for a data model: it works as documentation too
2. Create one view for each table you want to create in a tabular model
    - the view must belong to the schema that corresponds to the tabular project
    - the view should include only the columns that are useful and will be
    used in the tabular model.
    - The names of columns and tables should be identical to the exposed ones
    in tabular model and user friendly.
    - Remove prefix and sufix from visible fields, keep them for hidden fields
    - Use spaces to separate multiple words for visible columns, but do not use spaces
    in hidden columns names.
3. Import the views in the Tabular mode and remove the schema name
4. Split date and time in different columns

when you have no rows in the workspace database for the involved tables, or if the data
would be compatible with one-to-one relationship, then the cardinality drop down
list box will show all the possible options

Broken referential integrity: some values in the many side cannot be mapped to the
one side, must be sold because it can lead to confusion during Measures and calculations

Emulate a relationship when a column is not a good candidate for key
Sales [Sales Amount] :=
CALCULATE (
    SUMX ( Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Net Price] )
    INTERSECT (
        ALL ( Sales [ProductKey]),
        VALUES ( 'Product'[ProductKey])
    )
)
