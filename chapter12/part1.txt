Data size: bytes for all the compressed data in segments and partitions. It does not include dictionary and attribute hierarchies.

Columns Hierachies Size: number of bytes of automatically generated hierarchies for columns.

User Hierarchies Size: number of bytes for user defined hierarchies.

Relationship size: Number of bytes of relationships between tables-

Columns total size: This is the number of bytes of all the structures related to a column (sum of Data Size, Dictionary Size ands Columns Hierarchies size)

Dictionary Size: when 100 bytes or less it might be value encoding. bigger values are associated to hash encoding.

Memory / HardMemoryLimit – 0
Memory / LowMemoryLimit – 65
Memory / TotalMemoryLimit – 80
Memory / VertiPaqMemoryLimit – 60
Memory / VertiPaqPagingPolicy – 0

If you want to reduce memory for an instance of Analysis Services, it makes sense to set VertiPaqMemoryLimit to a number that is lower than LowMemoryLimit.

HardMemoryLimit is the maximum memory the system can ever have. If SSAS exceed the hard memory limit, the system will aggressively 
kill active sessions in order to reduce memory usage

TotalMemoryLimit is the high memory limit – it is used to calculate the memory price for normal cache eviction and memory cleaning. 
If it exceeds the total memory limit, the memory manager will evict all cached data which is not currently in use. TotalMemoryLimit must always be less than HardMemoryLimit.

LowMemoryLimit is the point where the system will begin cleaning memory out of caches. As memory usage increases above the low memory limit, 
SSAS get more aggressive about evicting cached data until it hits the high/total memory limit, at which point it evicts everything that isn’t pinned.
