Process name for SSAS: MSMDSRV.EXE

Possible optimization: remove the paging file from OS, only if there are no additional services

Memory settings are configured in the msmdsrv.ini file 

Service counters are in kb, use a scale of 0.00001

Order for limits:

1. LowMemoryLimit: the cleaner starts to clean some memory by using a graceful tactic.
2. TotalMemoryLimit has been surpassed: Cleaner is very aggresive. Cache is being cleared
3. HardMemoryLimit is surpassed: most aggresive cleaner, the connection is closed.

Optimizations:
1. Reduce column length and remove unnecesary data.
2. avoid date/time in the same column.
3. Order columns: you should try to put the least changing  columns first in the sort order

Dictionary costs:
1. with 1.000.000 numbers is approximately 20 to 30 MB
2. the cost of a string to be 16 bytes plus string length. 

Large tables: 1.000.000.000
Medium size: 100.000.000 to 200.000.000

for large tables - fact:
* Avoid creating calculated columns 

* Create aggregated tables:

SalesBySubcategory =
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS (
    Sales[StoreKey],
    Product[SubcategoryKey],
    Sales[Order Date],
    "Quantity", SUM(Sales[Quantity]),
    "Line Amount", [Sales Amount Product],
    "Line Cost", [Cost Product]
)

approaches for Near-Real time with partitions:
* ProcessData for daily partition: Create one partition per day to reprocess
* ProcessAdd for new transactions and rebuild with ProcessData at night
