Granting databse roles and administrative permissions
* None
* Read: Permission to read data from the tables, they can query the model.
* Process: Permission to process any object within the database, but not query it. Appropiate for SSIS.
* Read and Process.
* Administrator: Query, process, create, alter and delete any object. FOR DBAs.
Equivalent using SSMS:
* Full Control (administrator)
* Process database
* Read

Filtering on multiple columns:
= Product[Color] = "Black" && Product[ListPrice] > 3000
= [Color] <> "Black"

* To deny access to every row in the product table, you can use the folloing expression:
= FALSE()

One-to-Many Filtering
= Producr[Brand] = "Contoso"

On Sales or Many side

= ( RELATED ('Date'[Calendar Year Number]) = 2007
        && RELATED ('Product'[Color]) = "Black"
  )
||
( RELATED ('Date'[Calendar Year Number]) = 2008
        && RELATED ('Product'[Color]) = "Silver"
)

To retrieve the total of sales while also considering the products hidden by security roles, you can 
create a Daily Sales Calculated table that stores the total of sales day by day as follows:

Daily Sales = 
ADDCOLUMNS (
    ALLNONBLANKROW ( 'Date[DateKey]),
    "Total Daily Sales", [Sales Amount]
)

Sales[% All Sales] :=
DIVIDE ( [Sales Amount], SUM(Daily[Total Daily Sales]))

Using a permission table:
* A table with role and fields related to what they can see 
your role-filter expression on Sales can use:
= CONTAINS (
    PermissionYearColor,
    PermissionsYearColor [RoleName], "MyRole",
    PermissionsYearColor[CalendarYear], RELATED ('Date'[Calendar Year Number]),
    PermissionsYearColor [Color], RELATED('Product'[Color])
)
Hide the permissions table and set 
= FALSE ()
to avoid roles can query this table

DAX functions for dynamic security:
* USERNAME: This returns the Windows user name of the user
* CUSTOMDATA: the string value that has been passed to the CustomData connection string property

EVALUATE 
ROW (
    "Results from Username", USERNAME(),
    "Results from CustomData", CUSTOMDATA()
)

Force role
IF (
    CUSTOMDATA () = "",
    FALSE (),
    Product[Brand] = CUSTOMDATA()
)

in connection:
Roles=CustomDataRole; CustomData=Contoso
