Hardware most important points for deployment:
1. CPU clock and model
2. Memory speed
3. Number of cores
4. memory size

Machine with huge RAM can be slower because of the architecture required to manage such huge RAM (NUMA)
3 GHz or more for clock speed

if your databases do not have large tables, you should give a higher priority to the clock speed

You need at least 2 or 3 times the space required to store a compressed database in memory 
Memory bandwidth is key 

Analysis Services 2016 sp1 is NUMA-aware 

NUMA settings:
* ThreadPool\Query\GroupAffinity
* Vertipaq\ThreadPool\GroupAffinity

Analysis Services utilizes the high availability and scalability mechanisms built into the Windows server platform: 
* network load balancing (NLB), 
* Window Server Failover Clustering (WSFC), or both.
You cannot configure an Analysis Services instance to run in an Always On availability group
Load balancing, coupled with multiple read-only databases, give you both scale and high availability 
because all nodes are active, and when a server goes down, requests are automatically redistributed among the 
remaining nodes. When you need both scalability and availability, an NLB cluster is the right choice.
